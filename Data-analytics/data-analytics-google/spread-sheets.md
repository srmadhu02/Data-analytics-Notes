# Spread Sheets

A spreadsheet helps you structure data in rows and columns, prepare data for analysis, and create custom data visualizations. To better analyze your data, you clean up your chart to make it more visually appealing and to clarify what data means by making your chart more descriptive. To do that, itâ€™s important to add chart titles and axis titles. Ultimately, this is an essential skill to master because clear, descriptive data visualizations help data analysts be great storytellers.
