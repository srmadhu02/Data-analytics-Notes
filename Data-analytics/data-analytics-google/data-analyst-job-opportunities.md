# Data Analyst job opportunities

## Business use of data

A good reflection on this topic would consider how a specific kind of data can help a company, product, or service improve its customer service experience.

For example, consider a restaurant that delivers cold food to customers. More data about the delivery process, such as the average delivery time or the average number of daily deliveries, could help the restaurant streamline the process and deliver food on time.

Data analytics helps businesses make better decisions, but getting there is a process. It begins with analyzing a business problem, identifying data about that problem, and then using data analysis to arrive at an answer. Sometimes you get an answer that solves your business problem, but it’s often just as likely that you discover other questions to investigate further.



* You **asked** an interesting question and defined a problem to solve through data analysis to answer that question.&#x20;
* You thought deeply about what data you would need and how you would collect it in order to **prepare** for analysis.
* You **processed** your data by organizing and structuring it in a table and then moving it to a spreadsheet.&#x20;
* You **analyzed** your data by inspecting and scanning it for patterns.
* You **shared** your first data visualization: a bar chart.
* Finally, after completing all the other steps, you **acted**: You reflected on your results, made decisions, and gained insight into your problem--even if that insight was that you didn't have enough data, or that there were no obvious patterns in your data.&#x20;

#### Power of data in business

An **issue** is a topic or subject to investigate.&#x20;

A **question** is designed to discover information and a **problem** is an obstacle or complication that needs to be worked out.

#### Business Task

A business task is the question or problem data analysis answers for business.

**Data-driven decision-making** is when facts that have been discovered through data analysis are used to guide business strategy.

**Fairness** means ensuring that your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias. In other words, as a data analyst, you want to help create systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone.

Ensuring that analysis does not create or reinforce bias requires using processes and systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone.

#### Scenario 1:

Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! This is an example of unfair practice. It is tempting to conclude—as the administration did—that the workshop was a success. However, since the workshop was voluntary and not random, it is not appropriate to infer a causal relationship between attending the workshop and the higher rating.

The workshop might have been effective, but other explanations for the differences in the ratings cannot be ruled out. For example, another explanation could be that the staff volunteering for the workshop were the better, more motivated teachers. This group of teachers would be rated higher whether or not the workshop was effective.

It’s also notable that there is no direct connection between student survey responses and workshop attendance. The data analyst could correct this by asking for the teachers to be selected randomly to participate in the workshop. They could also collect data that measures something more directly related to workshop attendance, such as the success of a technique the teachers learned in that workshop.



#### Scenario 2:

Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! This case study shows an unfair practice. While the researchers test the prototype on three different tracks, they only conduct tests during the day.

Conditions on each track may be very different during the day and night and this could change the results significantly. The data analyst should correct this by asking the test team to add in nighttime testing to get a full perspective of how the prototype performs at any time of the day on the tracks.



#### Scenario 3:

Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! This case study contains an unfair practice. While the decision to distribute surveys in places where visitors would have time to respond makes sense, it accidentally introduces sampling bias.

The only respondents to the survey are people waiting in line for the roller coasters. This may unfairly bias survey results, because respondents might prefer roller coasters. A data analyst could reduce sampling bias by distributing the survey at the entrance and exit of the amusement park. This would avoid targeting roller coaster fans and provide results from the park’s general audience.
