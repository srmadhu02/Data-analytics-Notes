# Data Analyst job opportunities

## Business use of data

A good reflection on this topic would consider how a specific kind of data can help a company, product, or service improve its customer service experience.

For example, consider a restaurant that delivers cold food to customers. More data about the delivery process, such as the average delivery time or the average number of daily deliveries, could help the restaurant streamline the process and deliver food on time.

Data analytics helps businesses make better decisions, but getting there is a process. It begins with analyzing a business problem, identifying data about that problem, and then using data analysis to arrive at an answer. Sometimes you get an answer that solves your business problem, but itâ€™s often just as likely that you discover other questions to investigate further.



* You **asked** an interesting question and defined a problem to solve through data analysis to answer that question.&#x20;
* You thought deeply about what data you would need and how you would collect it in order to **prepare** for analysis.
* You **processed** your data by organizing and structuring it in a table and then moving it to a spreadsheet.&#x20;
* You **analyzed** your data by inspecting and scanning it for patterns.
* You **shared** your first data visualization: a bar chart.
* Finally, after completing all the other steps, you **acted**: You reflected on your results, made decisions, and gained insight into your problem--even if that insight was that you didn't have enough data, or that there were no obvious patterns in your data.&#x20;
